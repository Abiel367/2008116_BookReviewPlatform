Self-Assessment – Frontend Development

Working on the frontend for the Book Review Platform has been both challenging and educational. One of my key strengths throughout this project was my understanding of React Native fundamentals. I was able to create multiple screens, including the Welcome screen, user login and registration, admin login, the user dashboard, and the review form. I successfully applied functional components along with hooks like useState and useEffect to manage state and component lifecycles. Additionally, I structured an authentication context (AuthContext) and set up API integration with axios, demonstrating a solid grasp of token-based authentication and handling POST, PUT, and GET requests. On the design side, I made deliberate choices to create a readable and modular layout, including the use of buttons, lists, modals, and forms, even though I could not fully test the UI.

Despite these achievements, I faced several significant challenges. Setting up the development environment was one of the biggest obstacles. The Android SDK was not installed correctly, and adb was not recognized in the terminal, which prevented me from running the app on an emulator or physical device. Additionally, dependency issues such as missing or unresolved packages (@react-native-async-storage/async-storage) blocked the app from running entirely. I also encountered deprecated components like SafeAreaView and version mismatches in Expo, which further complicated testing. Network errors prevented me from verifying API calls in practice, leaving some logic untested, and the inability to run Expo meant I could not validate visual elements or user interactions, such as selecting a genre or submitting a review.

Through these difficulties, I learned the importance of a proper development environment. Setting up the SDK, ensuring compatibility between Expo and dependencies, and configuring system paths are all critical steps that can make or break the ability to test and iterate on a project. I also recognized the value of writing modular, well-structured code. By keeping components and logic separate, I was able to make meaningful progress even when the app could not run, which will make debugging and UI testing easier in the future. Using AI assistance effectively was another learning point; I relied on guidance for code patterns, explanations, and troubleshooting tips, but I wrote all the core functionality myself. This approach allowed me to understand the concepts rather than simply copying solutions.

Going forward, my action plan includes resolving the environment issues by installing the Android SDK, setting the ANDROID_HOME path, ensuring adb is accessible, and updating all necessary packages. Once the environment is functional, I will test the frontend thoroughly, focusing on UI behavior, user interactions, and API integration. I also plan to continue documenting the prompts and guidance I receive from AI to improve my workflow in future projects. Overall, despite the challenges, this project has strengthened my understanding of React Native development, taught me how to approach technical problems systematically, and reinforced the importance of combining independent coding with strategic AI assistance.
